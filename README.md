# Tree construction from traversals

This project is created to investigate what information can be known about a tree (not necessarily a sorted tree) from only two of its traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder). In its current state, the program brute-force checks all possible trees with the given items against the given traversals and displays the ones that match.

My future goals are to determine some logic behind the relationship between traversals and possible trees.
